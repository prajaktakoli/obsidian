-  âœ… **What is a Component in Angular?**

A **component** is the fundamental building block of an Angular application, responsible for:
- **Controlling a section of the UI** (via its template).
- **Handling logic and data** via a TypeScript class.
- **Applying metadata** using the `@Component` decorator.

### âœ… **Key Parts of a Component**


`@Component({   selector: 'app-user',   templateUrl: './user.component.html',   styleUrls: ['./user.component.css'] }) export class UserComponent {   name = 'Prajakta'; }`

- `selector`: HTML tag used to embed the component.
- `templateUrl`: Path to the HTML file for the component's UI.
- `styleUrls`: CSS styles for that component.
- `class`: Contains data & methods (business logic).

npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new my-first-app
cd my-first-app
ng serve
ng new app-name              # Create new Angular app
ng serve                     # Run app locally (localhost:4200)
ng generate component myComp # Create component (auto updates module)
ng generate service myService # Create service
ng build                     # Build app for production
