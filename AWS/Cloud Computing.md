On Premise
 - High price, less scalability
 - No automatic software updates
 - less collaboration 
 - Data cannot be accessed remotely
 - More implementation time
Cloud
- High flexibility - Scale up, pay more, Scale down, pay more
- Automatic software updates
- Collaboration is widespread across different locations
- Data can be accessed and shared anywhere over the internet
- less implementation time
--------------------------------------------
Cloud Computing : it delivers on demand computing services over the internet on pay as you go basis
Eg. Instaed of saving files on local storage device, store it on the internet

Deployment Model 
Public  - Cost effective, pay only for stuff which you are using, cloud infrasture made available to the general public over the internet and owned by cloud provider
Private - Very costly, cloud infrastruture is managed by a single company, may exists as on premise or off premise
Hybrid - Combination of public + private
- For eg. federal agencies use private cloud to share sensitive information and public cloud to share datasets with general public
