JVM is platform dependent
Java is not
JVM understands only bytecode, so java code needs to be convert into byte code which is a compiler so javac is used and then bytecode will run on jvm
main function is needed

in java, everything should be an object. It also means that evrything should be in a class
- Extension for bytecode - .class and java code is - .java
Commands 
javac hello.java ( hello is filename) : it is used for compilation
java Hello (Hello is classname) :  used to run code
